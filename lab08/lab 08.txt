for lab08:
Exercise One:
1.which hash functions performed better:
first let's check the St Dev Bucket length of each hash function:
silly: 69.374
Naive Add:4.231
Naive Mult 4.686
Add Lin Cong: 4.231
Sequential Lc:4.479
Folding:4.299
Java HashCode:4.589
Seq Java Hash code:4.430.
for the data i put in.
we can see that Naive Add and Add Lin cong are the best two hash function.
Folding is the second better hash function we get.
2.Did you need the "industrial-strength" hash functions near the end of the list:
No, the Java HashCode and Seq Java Hash code are not the best hash functions in
the list(for the data i choosed). they are not in the first three places.
3.Which was the simplest hash function to do reasonably well:
it is the Naive Add. it is on the second place in the list, but gives us the best
performence.

exercise two:
1.What do you observe:
under the same Talbe size, prime nmubers work better than the
the normal number(like 12). Also, when the prime number get bigger
the hash function's performence will get better.

exercise three:
