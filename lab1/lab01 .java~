Problem 1:
(i)
 A B + C D + *
  
(ii)
 A B C + * D *
  
(iii)
 A B * C D + + E G + *
  
(iv)
 A B + C + A B C * + *
Problem 2:
  
  after all the steps, the result is 19
 
Problem 3:
 if we put a sequence like
  3 + 2 3 4 + + +
 the stack will underflow from the second step, because when we meet the first postfix
  "+", there is only one number in the stack:3. The code will .pop()twice,but there is 
  only one number in the stack. Then it will underflow.

Problem 4:
if we have already have 
  
Problem 5:
